pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.loginLocationsDescription=When users authenticate into the system, their session must be associated with a Login Location. This location is used determine what functionality and workflows should be available, and is the default location associated with any <b>encounters</b> and other data that this user records during this session. A user can change their login location at any point in time by clicking on the name of their currently selected location in the page header.  Specific locations are designated as <em>Login Locations</em> by associating them with the <em>Login Location</em> tag.
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.visitLocationsDescription=Each login location must be associated with exactly one visit location. Visit locations are used to determine what location to assign to any <b>visits</b> that are created during the user session.  In order to do this, each location that is tagged as a <em>Login Location</em> must itself be tagged as a <em>Visit Location</em>, or must be a descendent of a location tagged as a Visit Location.

pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.moreInfo=More info
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.singleLocation=Single Visit and Login Location
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.singleLocationDescriptionShort=Single health center or small facility, all encounters and visits are associated with the overall facility location.
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.singleLocationDescriptionLong=Health centers and similar smaller facilities will typically configure a location representing the overall facility as the only Visit Location, and will also tag this location as the only Login Location.  This will eliminate the need for users to choose their location after login, and will automatically assign all user sessions to this single login location. All encounters, visits, and other data will be associated with this overall facility location and will configure this same location as the Visit Location.
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.multiDepartmentVisitLocation=Facility Location to associate with all visits
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.multiDepartmentLoginLocations=Please select the departments/services within {0} which users will log into and create encounters
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.multiDepartmentDescriptionShort=Single hospital or multi-department facility, all visits at a single facility, with encounters at different departments within that facility
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.multiDepartmentDescriptionLong=Hospitals and similar larger facilities will typically configure a location representing the overall facility as the only Visit Location, but will then create locations representing each department/service that have this Visit Location as their parent location.  They will tag the department/service locations as login locations, but the overall facility visit location will not be tagged as a login location. This will enable encounters to be associated with individual department locations, and for multiple encounters at different departments within the facility to be associated with the same Visit at the parent visit location.
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.multiFacilityDescriptionShort=System serving multiple facilities.  Visits and encounters will be created at different facilities.
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.multiFacilityDescriptionLong=Systems that are set up to serve multiple distinct facilities will typically configure a location representing each of the supported facilities as a <em>Visit Location</em>.  It would then configure the Login Locations associated with each configured Visit Location based on one of the two preferred setups above.  All Login Locations must be associated with only a single ancestor Visit Location.
pihapps.admin.configureLoginLocations.multiFacilityLocations=Please choose the locations that should be denoted as Visit Locations and Login Locations
